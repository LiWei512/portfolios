</p>When I was a primary school child, I dreamed of being the greatest physicist scientist. Because I heard a lot about Isaac Newton, Thomas Alva Edison, and Albert Einstein's changing world stories when I was in a primary school. Also, I was interested in physics.</p>
</p>As I grow, when I was a high school child, My dream changed because I loved computer games, and I heard a lot about the greatest innovators like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who leads the information age.</p>
</p>When I was a child, Maybe I think I want to be a hero who changes the world.</p>
</p>So I started to study programming languages when I was 13 years. My first programming language C and I used Borland Turbo C compiler. I loved to solve some math problems with programming.</p>
</p>As I grow, I studied Information Technology and Economics at University. When I was finding a new opportunity that can change the world, I was very excited about Bitcoin. Because I first heard that Bitcoin is decentralized money, so any party like the US can't ban the money liquidity. So I got interested in cryptocurrency and Blockchain.</p>
</p>Now I am working on moving the blockchain technology to reality. So I keep on studying and working on Blockchain and Web development.</p>
</p>Also, I continuously learn something new to be a hero.</p>
</p>Contact me anytime when you have a great idea.</p>
